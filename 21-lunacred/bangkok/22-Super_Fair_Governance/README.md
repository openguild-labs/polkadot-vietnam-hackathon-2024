# Project Super Fair Governance

## Introduction
The super fair governance system is a voting governance tool based on the principle of unanimous consent. Super fair governance originates from the cake cutting problem (Typical solutions to the cake cutting problem include envy-free division and super fair division, which are two decentralized decision-making techniques based on the principle of unanimous consent).
The super fair governance system provides super fair solutions for disputes and conflicts with clear ownership. It can solve the governance attack and apathy problems faced by the current voting governance system.
